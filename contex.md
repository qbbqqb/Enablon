Project Context ‚Äî Enablon Observation Bundler (Next.js)
Role & Goal

You are a senior TypeScript + Next.js engineer. Build a single-screen web app where a user drops photos (+ optional notes), selects a project, clicks Make my CSV, and receives a ZIP containing:

observations.csv (Compass/Enablon-compliant, exact headers/order)

photos/ (renamed versions of uploaded images)

manifest.json (row ‚Üî filename mapping)

FAILED.json (optional; items skipped or repaired)

Must feel ‚Äúmagic‚Äù: one page, one button, auto-download, minimal choices.

Non-Goals (MVP)

No accounts/auth, no DB, no S3, no queues.

No direct Enablon API push (file export only).

No multi-user collaboration.

Tech Stack (minimal, production-friendly)

Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui

Uploads: HTML5 drag-drop (or UploadThing if preferred)

Media: sharp (HEIC‚ÜíJPG, resize), exifr (optional)

ZIP: archiver

AI: Gemini 2.5 Pro Vision (single strict prompt per micro-batch)

Validation: local schema checks (no external libs required)

Everything happens in memory + /tmp within a single request. Optimize for 10‚Äì60 photos.

Single Screen UX

Dropzone: accepts jpg/png/heic (multi-file, up to 60)

Textarea: Notes (optional)

Select: Project (GVX03 | GVX04 | GVX05, default GVX04)

Primary Button: Make my CSV

Progress bar + label (optimistic by micro-batch): ‚ÄúAnalysing 24/48 photos‚Ä¶‚Äù

Auto-download ZIP when ready; success toast ‚ÄúAll set‚Äîready for Enablon üéâ‚Äù

Endpoint (one route)

POST /api/generate (multipart/form-data)

Fields: project (string, GVX03/GVX04/GVX05), notes (string, optional), files[] (images)

Server flow (strict order):

Parse form

Normalize images

HEIC‚ÜíJPG via sharp

Resize longest edge to 1600 px, JPEG quality ~0.7

Track original order index

If image still >10MB after compression ‚Üí skip and record in FAILED.json

Micro-batch AI

Chunk images into batches of 8; process with concurrency = 2

One Gemini call per batch ‚Üí STRICT JSON array (one object per image, same order)

Post-process & repair

Fill constants + mappings (below)

Enforce HRA vs General exclusivity

If a batch returns invalid JSON: one ‚Äúrepair to schema‚Äù attempt; otherwise skip those items and record in FAILED.json

Build outputs

observations.csv (UTF-8 with BOM, CRLF, exact header order below)

Rename photos (pattern below)

manifest.json (row ‚Üî renamed files)

FAILED.json (only if needed)

Stream ZIP back (Content-Type: application/zip) and cleanup /tmp

Default limits (ship these)

Max files: 60

Max total upload: 200 MB

AI batch size: 8

AI concurrency: 2

Exclusivity rule

If Category Type = General Category ‚áí General Category set, High Risk empty

Quick image‚Üícategory rules

Cable drum without chocks ‚Üí HRA: Material Handling

Rebar without caps ‚Üí General: Walking, Working Surfaces

Photo Renaming Pattern

ObsNo = zero-padded (001, 002, ‚Ä¶) by row order

CategoryOrHRA = if HRA use that value, else General Category

shortslug = 3‚Äì4 keywords from description; ASCII; ‚â§80 chars; dedupe with -2, -3

AI Prompt (use per micro-batch)

System/Instruction (verbatim skeleton):

Role: construction safety inspector producing Compass/Enablon rows

Output: STRICT JSON array; one object per image in input order; no extra fields; British English

Timezone: Europe/Stockholm; Notification Date = today (DD/MM/YYYY)

Use only the enumerations provided (lists above).

Object must include exactly the 15 fields (same names as CSV headers).

Apply the quick rules (drum‚ÜíHRA/Material Handling, rebar‚ÜíWalking, barriers‚ÜíBarricades, housekeeping‚ÜíHousekeeping, pipe‚ÜíLine of Fire, egress‚ÜíEmergency Preparedness).

Return only JSON: [ {15-field object}, ... ].

Server passes: project, notes, binary images array.
Server enforces exclusivity and mappings if model misses them.

Acceptance Checklist (Done = true)

Drop 10‚Äì60 photos ‚Üí click Make my CSV ‚Üí one ZIP auto-downloads

observations.csv has exact 15 headers, UTF-8 BOM, CRLF; imports to Enablon/Compass with zero edits

Photos are renamed per pattern; manifest.json maps rows ‚Üî photos

HRA/General exclusivity always correct

FAILED.json present only if items skipped; app never crashes‚Äîalways returns a ZIP

Implementation Tasks (micro)

UI page: dropzone, notes, project select, button, optimistic progress, auto-download on success.

API route: parse multipart; normalize (heic‚Üíjpg, resize); micro-batch AI (8, concurrency 2); repair/enforce schema; build CSV; rename photos; stream ZIP; cleanup.

AI call: strict prompt; return array per micro-batch; server validates and fixes trivial violations.


OpenRouter + Gemini 2.5 Pro (for Next.js app)
What we‚Äôre using

Provider: OpenRouter

Endpoint: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions 
OpenRouter

Model ID: google/gemini-2.5-pro 
OpenRouter

Headers (recommended):

Authorization: Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>

HTTP-Referer: <your app URL> (optional attribution)

X-Title: <your app name> (optional attribution) 
OpenRouter
+1

Multimodal input: send images in the message content array with type: "image_url" (URLs or data URLs) alongside text segments. 
OpenRouter

Streaming (not required for this MVP): set "stream": true if you later want token streaming. 
OpenRouter

Env vars (add to .env.local)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
OPENROUTER_APP_URL=https://your-domain.tld
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=Enablon Observation Bundler
TZ=Europe/Stockholm

How we call it (shape & rules)

One request per micro-batch (8 images); concurrency = 2.

messages[0].role = "user" with content array:

First a text chunk containing the strict instructions + enumerations

Then one image_url object per image (either a public URL or a data:image/jpeg;base64,...)

Return only JSON (string). We‚Äôll JSON.parse it server-side and validate.

Message content shape (example):

{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "<STRICT prompt with columns/enums & rules>" },
        { "type": "image_url", "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." },
        { "type": "image_url", "image_url": "https://your-temp-url/photo2.jpg" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.2
}


(Using image_url for images is the OpenRouter multimodal convention. PDFs and audio use different types.) 
OpenRouter

Minimal analyzeImages() contract (Cursor should generate this)

Input: { files: FileLike[], project: 'GVX03'|'GVX04'|'GVX05', notes?: string }

Steps:

Convert HEIC‚ÜíJPG; resize to longest edge 1600px (‚âà0.7 JPEG quality).

Chunk into batches of 8; process with concurrency 2.

For each batch:

Build messages: strict text prompt + image data URLs (or temporary HTTPS URLs).

POST to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions with headers above.

Extract choices[0].message.content (Gemini via OpenRouter returns OpenAI-style payload). 
OpenRouter

JSON.parse ‚Üí validate/repair to schema (enforce HRA‚ÜîGeneral exclusivity; fill constants and mappings).

Merge arrays in original order ‚Üí return Observation[].

Headers boilerplate (Cursor can reuse)

Authorization: Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}

HTTP-Referer: ${process.env.OPENROUTER_APP_URL}

X-Title: ${process.env.OPENROUTER_APP_NAME}

Notes & tips

If you can host temporary images at an HTTPS URL, prefer that over giant base64 to keep requests lighter; data URLs still work.

Keep batch requests small (we‚Äôre using 8) to stay within model input limits and to improve reliability. (OpenRouter routes to many providers but uses OpenAI-compatible semantics and model naming like provider/model.)

If you ever need token streaming (e.g., to show live progress text), OpenRouter supports it via "stream": true and SSE‚Äîout of scope for this MVP.
